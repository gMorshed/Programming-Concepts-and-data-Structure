MyName: Gazi Mahbub Morshed
Collaborated with: Carlos Macedo, Kirwin Slawrench
Challanges: I had a hard time reading the imgae data out of the ppm file and flipping the image horizontally. 
So, I tried making psuedocode with different approaches for the problems. Alex showed an approach in class that I was able to follow and
I went on with it and able to load the data correctly. Moreover, for flipping the image, I approches the problem as if it's small 4*4 matrix and 
carried put the same idea. 
Like/dislike: I liked how the data arrangement was challenging. which gave the chance to think critically about them. I liked playing around 
with different structure and find the best fit. Only think that I didn't like about the assignment is "SEGMANTATION FAULT"
How long: approximately 8 hours
