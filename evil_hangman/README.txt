Challanges: I had difficulties implimenting the the word family map with the key as a strip down version of the word with the current guess and the values as the words itself. After trying a couple of ideas, 
I decided to do focus more on the algorithm and write out psuedocode. After brainstroming a couple of ideas, finally landed an efficent one and it worked!
Like/dislike: I liked how challanging the assignment was. The algorithm to not let the user win easily, really excites me.  
How long: approximately 10 hours 
I am giving the user an option if they want us to show how many words are remaining in their guessing list.
