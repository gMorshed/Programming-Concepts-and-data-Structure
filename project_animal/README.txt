Challanges: Understanding the tree structure was a bit challenging in the beginning. But reading through the description and office hours 
helped clear that up. The next biggest challenge was to expand the tree properly. The first couple of tims I was getting segmantation fault. 
After trying different things and looking over the code again and again, I realized I am not setting my leaf nodes pointers to be NULL.
That seemed to do the trick. 
Like/dislike: The liked how the assignment made me understand and impliment trees properly. I can see a lot of applications
of this and I'm very glad I got to practice with it. No dislikes in this assignment. 
How long: approximately 8 hours.
