Challanges: While implinating the to_string function, which is called by debug, I was popping of the stack elements while trying to add the elements in to a string for it to print.
But after debuging, all the elements were gone as I popped them. So I had to find a way to read elements of the stack without erasing them. Then it hit me that I can just make a temporary stack 
by copying off the actual stack and then it wouldn't matter if I erase the elements of the temporary stack.
Like/dislike: The liked how the assignment made me work with data structures and impliment them properly. I wished it was a bit complicated that it was. 
How long: approximately 2 hours 
Extra credit: I added exponentiation opeartor, and  unary operators for square root (sqrt), base 10 logarithm (log), natural logarithm (ln), 
and the trigonometric functions sine (sin), cosine (cos) and tangent (tan)
