Collaborated with:Kirwin Slawrench
Challanges: I had a difficulties understanding what exactly is the algorithm was supposed to do. After reading and 
through it a couple of times, office hours, TA hours, that was clear. I struggled making the generator method of the
word model. It was going out of bounds, giving floating point exception etc. So, I fired up GDB and went through
the code and was able to find my mistakes. 
Likes/ Dislikes: I liked how challanging it was to understand the algorithm behind markkov chain. I didn't 
like how there was a lot of files to keep track. It was cumbersome. 
Time Spent: 8-10 hours.
